    "text": "Ecological Disruption\nLithium is available primarily in the brines or related evaporites (66%), in pegmatites (26%) and sedimentary rocks (8%). (Gruber et al., 2011). The conventional methods for lithium mining are through brine evaporation and extraction in open pits from hard rock or clay deposits. The brine deposits are found in the ‘Lithium Triangle’ of Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia. Brine evaporation requires a large amount of water. It has been estimated that 1 ton of Li strip-mined in Chile was estimated to consume 540 tonnes of water and release 5 tonnes of CO2. Evaporation ponds from salt flats, known as salares, deplete water from aquifers in already arid environments. Large hard rock mines are found in Australia. The hard rock mines leak chemicals into water systems causing harm to local ecosystems and indigenous communities in these areas. New proposed lithium mines in Nevada, by a company called Ioneer, are displacing the native endangered buckwheat species."

    "text": "New Extraction Technologies\nA new technology of Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) is being developed to tackle the environmental impacts of conventional methods. It involves adsorption and ion exchange, that use chemical and physical processes to directly remove lithium from brine. An example is in the Imperial Valley in southern California, where large lithium deposits dissolved in brine deep below ground on the southern shore of the Salton Sea. This hot brine is extracted through geothermal wells to generate electricity at 11 power plants and then re-injected back underground. This requires lesser land area for evaporation, lesser water displacement, net energy usage (MIT, 2024), and nearly double the lithium production than current practices (Nicolaci et al., 2023)."

    "text": "Recycling and Alternate Solutions\nAnother solution to move away from the impacts of lithium extraction is to increase recycling. It has been proven that creating lithium-ion batteries from recycled battery materials can be up to 48% less in cost and create 54% less environmental impact (Gonzales-Calienes, 2023). Companies such as Redwood Materials in Nevada and Li-Cycle in Toronto are developing hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical technologies to recover minerals from Lithium-ion batteries while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions and other impacts.\nSecondary solutions to reduce overall dependence on lithium include the use of alternate batteries such as sodium-ion for stationary storage. Although sodium-ion batteries are less efficient than lithium and much heavier, their raw material sodium is present abundantly with fewer biogeochemical implications (Gagnon, 2024). Another emerging technology is the iron-air battery which uses a water-based electrolyte and stores energy using reversible rusting. (Asmare et al, 2024)"

    "section": "Barriers",
    "text": "Barriers\nThere are several social and economic barriers associated with each of these solutions. The largest barrier to the new DLE technology is the cost. Capital costs for DLE can be double the amount of the traditional lithium extraction methods, although it has a higher recovery rate of 70-90% compared to 30-40% for ponds (Nicolaci et al., 2023). While foreign companies own the machinery and equipment and may not want to invest in more expensive technologies, reducing the land area impact would give lands back, which have cultural and other economic benefits for the locals (MIT, 2024).\nLithium recycling also poses several barriers economically and environmentally. Current lithium recycling processes are extremely limited because of retrieval efficiency. In the European Union in 2012, less than 1% of lithium was recycled (UNEP data). A mass balance analysis reveals that pyrometallurgical lithium recycling has impacts in air pollution, hydrogen fluoride emissions (Fu et al., 2018), wastewater, and solid waste, while the hydrometallurgical route generates high volumes of wastewater (Swain, 2017). In addition, the health risks and effects of long-term high exposure are unknown (Nicolaci et al., 2023). Recycling solutions can only be effective if these impacts are managed. The barrier with alternate batteries is their scalability and energy density as compared to LIB. Reducing overall energy usage seems a straightforward pathway, but behavior change is arguably the most difficult change to make."

The environmental impacts of energy production and use of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas) are much higher than the renewables in GHG emissions, pollution, and land-use changes. We need to increase the share of renewable sources (solar and wind) for a clean energy transition because of their lower environmental impacts. The figure below compares energy demands and all renewable energy supplies per day per person in Britain. Assuming a similar trend to be followed in the US, it is possible to rely on renewable energy sources for around 90% of our energy demands. For the remaining 10%, we should rely on nuclear and hydroenergy because of their lower environmental impacts than fossil fuels. The figure counts offshore wind energy in Britain, which could be substituted to some extent with more solar PV energy in the US. The use of biomass should also be lower than what is shown in the figure because of its impacts on land-use changes."

The rest either ended up in landfills or was traded and informally recycled in developing countries, exposing workers to hazardous and carcinogenic substances such as mercury, lead, and cadmium. E-waste in landfills contaminates soil and groundwater, putting food supply systems and water sources at risk.

    "section": "",
    "text": "California is a global leader in EV deployment. It is now home to over one million plug-in EVs and motorcycles. In December 2020, Governor Newsom issued an Executive Order setting a goal that all new passenger vehicles sold in California be ZEVs (Zero Emission Vehicles) by 2035 and heavy-duty vehicle fleets be ZEVs by 2045. The EV batteries are under warranty for up to eight years of their lifespan of 10-15 years. Automotive OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) are required to recapture the vehicle traction batteries for repair or replacement only if they are within the warranty period. If the batteries are outside the warranty period, they are either repurposed or recycled depending on their condition by individual shops, dealerships, auto-dismantlers, and recyclers. No regulations exist for the batteries outside their warranty period. They are categorized as hazardous waste and are managed by the Department of Toxic Substances Control of California. EV batteries have the potential to harm human and environmental health if they leak into the environment instead of being properly disposed of.\n\n\n\nThe Responsible Battery Recycling Act of 2022 requires producers to establish a stewardship program for the collection and recycling of batteries. This Act does not cover vehicle batteries. In 2018, AB 2832 established a Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling Advisory Group to make policy recommendations to the Legislature to achieve a 100% rate of reuse or recycling for lithium-ion car batteries in the State. SB 615 establishes a program to ensure EV batteries are properly managed at every stage of their lives and are put to their highest and best use by requiring all EV batteries to be recycled at the end of their useful life.1 This measure will ensure those who handle batteries have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities. This bill puts a direct responsibility on the Vehicle Traction Battery Suppliers in California.\n\n\n\nThe bill has been passed in the California Senate with a 100% majority. It is currently under consideration by the Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials Committee in the Assembly. Auto-dismantlers, repair dealerships, and recyclers will receive a supply boost in their business if the bill gets passed. The bill presents an opportunity for the EV industry to drive down costs of future domestic battery production with recycling and pass those savings to consumers. It will give rise to partnerships between OEMs, recyclers, and auto-dismantlers for efficient and safe execution. Ultimately, it will accelerate the transition to clean transportation and support the Zero Emission Vehicle Goals set by Governor Newsom.\n\n\n\nThe central ideas influencing this policy are effective management of hazardous battery waste, ownership to manufacturers, a resilient domestic value chain of raw materials, and an advance in the clean energy transition. The interest groups supporting these ideas for this policy are clean transportation coalitions (CALSTART), and non-profit organizations advocating for hazardous waste management (California Against Waste), circular economy (National Stewardship Action Council), and transition to renewable energy and EVs (Climate Reality Project, Plug-in America). These interest groups openly advocate for this policy and educate electorates about its core ideas. OEMs are most important in executing this policy.

    "text": "California is a global leader in EV deployment. It is now home to over one million plug-in EVs and motorcycles. In December 2020, Governor Newsom issued an Executive Order setting a goal that all new passenger vehicles sold in California be ZEVs (Zero Emission Vehicles) by 2035 and heavy-duty vehicle fleets be ZEVs by 2045. The EV batteries are under warranty for up to eight years of their lifespan of 10-15 years. Automotive OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) are required to recapture the vehicle traction batteries for repair or replacement only if they are within the warranty period. If the batteries are outside the warranty period, they are either repurposed or recycled depending on their condition by individual shops, dealerships, auto-dismantlers, and recyclers. No regulations exist for the batteries outside their warranty period. They are categorized as hazardous waste and are managed by the Department of Toxic Substances Control of California. EV batteries have the potential to harm human and environmental health if they leak into the environment instead of being properly disposed of."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The original intent in the discovery period of our environmental venture was to address environmental inflection points in the critical minerals and materials supply chain of the quickly growing renewable energy infrastructure industry such as EV Batteries, Turbines, Grid Structure, etc.\n\n\n\nCritical minerals like Lithium, Cobalt, Nickel, Copper, and Manganese drive the advancement of the renewable energy transition. To build renewable energy infrastructure such as EV batteries, solar panels, and battery storage systems, we need to ensure a robust and resilient supply chain of these minerals. The supply chain components for these critical minerals are spread globally. Global coordination and harmony are required to ensure a smooth flow of these minerals. Yet, this is not what occurs, as differing geopolitical tensions and ties have created bottlenecks in various regions across the world in this supply chain. This has made the supply chain critically insecure and non-transparent, and oftentimes, this obfuscation is used to export environmental issues in industries extracting and using these materials to regions with lax regulatory practices.\nIt is important to first trace the environmental impacts of the critical minerals in the mining, refining, production, and disposal stages to then manage and reduce them. The environmental issues associated with mining include the exposure of mine workers to toxic gases and materials. Groundwater is often used to extract Lithium, which leads to water shortages in the local communities. Acid mine drainage and land use alteration are also caused by mining activities. In refining, the environmental issues include air, water, and soil pollution, and ecosystem toxicity due to the leakage of toxic materials. Similar impacts are seen if the products are not handled and disposed of safely during end-of-life.\nOur project aimed to find solutions to improve traceability and circularity of the critical minerals supply chain. We narrowed down our focus to Lithium, Cobalt, Nickel, Copper, and Manganese, which are used in EV batteries.\n\n\n\nThrough our research, we attempted to identify 3 potential ventures to remediate issues we found within industries surrounding critical minerals and materials. While each identified venture is not unfeasible, we found that the level of support needed for some of our ventures, or the inherent structure of our frameworks, was not sufficient to produce a workable venture in the program length. Below is a summary of our 3 venture ideas, with a background, attempted solution, and reasoning for being unable to move forward with the issue.\n\n\n\n\nThis venture iteration was founded on the idea of creating a ‘scorecard’ of sorts to analyze and grade suppliers and materials based on their environmental and human rights impacts. This would theoretically make it easier for procurers and consumers to know where their products’ materials were coming from and how ‘good’ they are. The framework was to be narrowed down toward EV Batteries, taking inspiration from JD Power & Associates\n\n\n\nWe found through our interviews (most specifically with Allosense and Tesla) that in developing a verification framework, we would need sensitive proprietary corporate information. This information is not freely available, and we found that companies were and are largely unwilling to work with universities in this area. We found that we would need a large partner (government entity) that could use its power/influence to coerce companies into providing this information. We realized early on that the work needed to do so was not feasible for us or necessarily relevant to the main purpose of the Eco-E Opportunity project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis venture idea was founded during our research into how recyclers (such as Redwood Materials) track/procure/source their materials and the general environmental impacts of EV Battery circularity. It became apparent that:\nA) Recycling has little environmental impact and is advanced enough to handle most battery types.\nB) Recyclers do not have enough supply of end-of-life batteries, as most are still ‘young’ and their end-of-life is over 20~ years away. In turn, they struggle to source materials for market viability.\nWe came up with the idea of creating a network/service that tracked and transported small electronics that have critical materials inside of them for these recyclers and to move these products away from landfills.\n\n\n\nTransportation/Logistics ventures are notoriously difficult, and it would be incredibly hard for us to generate revenue from this venture. The resources and time available to us made this venture non-feasible. In addition, we would have to verify each recycler as a safe disposal site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis idea drew inspiration from the proposed framework for the EU’s battery passport. The main frame was that we would create an application/service that tracked the events throughout a battery’s ‘first life’. This would include data such as usage, location, damages, events of significance, etc., that the battery may have experienced as it moved through its life. This info could then be used for those who utilize these products at end-of-life for best practices.\n\n\n\nAfter some insight and thinking this venture was found to be non-revenue generating, as the framework aligned more with that of a non-profit, running counter to the requirements of an Eco-E Opportunity Project. In addition, an identifier would require participation from key players in multiple industries across the supply chain, alongside regulatory backing to make the scale of adoption needed occur.\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough our primary research, we found that innovating in battery frameworks or identifiers requires collaboration across all the key players in the market. Most innovations need backing from government policies and regulations to be implemented widely. All the interconnected supply chain components across the globe must comply for these innovations to take off. This has been achieved to an extent through the Global Battery Alliance’s Battery Passport supported by the European Union.\nIn the battery recycling industry in the US, Redwood Materials is leading with technological innovations in cathode and anode production from a mixture of recycled and virgin materials. Their challenge is an insufficient supply of recyclable minerals from batteries. Most of the EV batteries are in use and have not reached their end-of-life yet. The alternate option of extracting minerals from consumer electronics products has a low yield, considering the small quantities of the minerals present in these devices. Despite these challenges, the recycling industry needs to catch up in the coming decade to the expected increase in the supply of end-of-life batteries.\nIn an attempt to boost the domestic mining and recycling businesses and secure its domestic supply chain for these critical minerals and materials, the US government has limited tax credits only if a certain percentage of the minerals are domestically sourced. The applicable percentage was 40% in 2023 and is increased by 10% every year.1 Another policy under development is the California Vehicle Traction Bill (CA SB 615).2 This bill requires all electric vehicle traction batteries in California to be recovered and reused, repurposed, remanufactured, or remanufactured and eventually recycled at the end of their useful life.\nIn an interview with a Tesla manager, we found that they face challenges in identifying where the minerals come from. Instead of tracing the supply chain map, they would prefer a way to find out where the mineral came from by examining its properties. With further literature review in this area, we discovered a research paper on geochemical Lithium identifiers that can map Lithium to its mining source based on its isotope.3\nAdditionally, we found through our interviews that changing consumer sentiment and the expectation of future regulations have pushed various industries (especially the automotive industry) to innovate consistently. Just as well, corporate powers have begun to face both internal and external pressures to be more sustainable and environmentally responsible and this is pushing them to be more responsible to stay competitive.\nCitations:\n\nTreasury releases proposed guidance to continue the U.S. manufacturing boom in batteries and clean vehicles, and strengthen energy security.

    "text": "Climate change caused by global carbon emissions threatens human existence as we know it today. Current mitigation efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are important, but experts agree that carbon dioxide removal is required to keep global temperatures below the critical 1.5°C warming (Lebling et al., 2022).\nDirect air capture (DAC) is a new technology that uses chemical reactions to attract and trap CO2 out of ambient air. The process includes large fans that draw air across either liquid solvents or solid sorbents, which selectively react with carbon dioxide and remove it with 75% efficiency while letting other chemicals pass through (Lebling et al., 2022; Valentine and Zoelle, 2024). Once trapped, the CO2 is released from the solvents and sorbents through a heating process. There are several fates for the captured carbon dioxide. For long-term sequestration, it is injected deep underground, where it will remain for thousands of years. Carbon dioxide can also be sold for use in concrete or plastic, which has a shorter cycle. A third and poorer option is to convert it back into fossil fuels or carbon dioxide for beverages, which releases the carbon immediately back into the air. Capture carbon can also be used in synthetic jet fuel. While this is less emission-intensive than fossil fuels, it promotes the continued use of fossil fuels (Lebling et al., 2022). There are three major companies in direct air capture: Climeworks, Carbon Engineering, and Global Thermostat. In total, they have 18 plants that each capture between 1-4,000 tons of CO2/year, for a total of 8,000 tons of CO2 captured per year. At this point, half of the CO2 is sequestered underground permanently, and half is sold as products (Lebling et al., 2022)."

    "text": "Cost and Feasibility\nA case study done in 2024 by the Department of Energy and the National Energy Technology Laboratory explores liquid solvent-based carbon capture to compare the cost and performance estimates of two models with different carbon sequestration capacities. Case 1 had a net carbon removal of 903,970 tons of CO2/year and cost $293/ton. The second case removed 100,000 tons of CO2/year and cost $486/ton. This analysis does not include capital costs of infrastructure and instead assumes mature technology and thus immediate costs may be significantly higher. At this point, the cost of direct air capture is higher than point source CO2 capture and significantly higher than reforestation, which costs $50/ton of CO2 removed (Lebling et al., 2022; Valentine and Zoelle, 2024). The study concluded that direct air capture is still in its large-scale prototype phase and much more research and development needs to be done to drop the costs (Valentine and Zoelle, 2024). While projected costs are high, Climeworks estimates costs to drop to $200/tonne in the next three to four years, with a long-term goal of under $100/tonne by 2030 (ClimeWorks, 2019). This is still double the cost of reforestation."

    "text": "Policies and Regulations\nThere is significant government support through policies and subsidies for the implementation of direct air capture, which will aid in decreasing costs. The Department of Energy has allotted 129 million dollars and has Direct Air Capture Hub awards to help scale the technology (Andreason, 2023). In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act enacted the 45Q Tax Credit that provides $35-50/ton CO2 removal through direct air capture or point source capture. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has set aside several billion dollars for DAC hubs and fund infrastructure like CO2 pipelines and geologic sequestration (Lebling et al., 2022; Valentine and Zoelle, 2024). Current US policies support DAC, but none put limitations on the sale and use of captured carbon, which may limit the positive impacts of DAC."

    "section": "Advantages",
    "text": "Advantages\nDirect air capture promises advantages as being a permanent carbon dioxide storage solution. Unlike many natural solutions, the direct air capture methods are measurable, verifiable, and reportable. It can capture legacy emissions already present in the atmosphere as opposed to carbon capture at its emission point source. A major benefit of direct air capture is its flexibility in land use. It does not require arable land, which minimizes the impact on food production and other land use changes. Also, it requires a smaller amount of land per tonne of CO2 removed than traditional carbon removal techniques like reforestation. (Lebling, 2022). DAC promises the potential of creating well-paying jobs for people with skills in construction, plumbing, electrical works, operations, and manufacturing. While phasing out fossil fuels will lead to high unemployment, skills from the fossil fuel industry are transferable to the DAC industry. (Andreason, J., 2023)."

    "section": "Tradeoffs",
    "text": "Tradeoffs\nThe tradeoffs associated with direct air capture must be weighed while considering its contribution to the carbon removal portfolio. DAC plants require high investments and high energy requirements. The carbon captured in these plants should be considerably higher than the carbon emitted in construction and energy use to pay off the investments. The technology is not yet advanced enough to capture emissions at a large scale. There are issues with leakage during the injection of carbon into the storage wells. The injection could cause fractures in the protective layers of the well. (S. Holloway, 2008). Studies show that fluid injection induces seismicity that poses a further risk of leakage at carbon storage sites. (A. Nicol, 2011). As carbon is often stored around oil and gas wells, the original bores can also create pathways for leaks."

    "text": "Health Risks\nThe leakage of carbon dioxide from pipelines and storage causes severe immediate breathing issues for the local communities. Increased dose of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is deadly and toxic as experienced during the Denbury carbon pipe leaks in Mississippi. (Zegart, 2021) In addition to the carbon pollution in the air and the risk of earthquakes, there are public health and safety issues associated with DAC for vulnerable communities. DAC technology relies on two toxic solvents that have no sustainable disposal solutions yet. (Qiu, 2022) Aqueous hydroxide solutions release deadly and corrosive chlorine gas. (Zhang, 2014) Amine-modified solutions produce chemical carcinogens at a rate that exceeds toxicity limits for drinking water and aquatic ecosystems. (Karl, 2011). These are all serious health risks that must be addressed if DAC is scaled."

    "section": "Mitigation First",
    "text": "Mitigation First\nAlong with the disadvantages and environmental justice concerns, DAC also has unintended impacts in diminished mitigation efforts. DAC has been used as a tool by oil and gas companies to offset emissions and enhance extraction and recovery. Most of the captured carbon goes into oil wells to flush out the last dregs of oil. This will ultimately lead to more emissions with enhanced fossil fuel burning than what was captured. With subsidies and tax credits offered for the DAC projects, the focus is shifting from reducing the emissions at the source. The overall impacts related to local pollution, public health risks, ecosystem toxicity, and the ultimate use of stored carbon should be accounted for before making huge investments in DAC hubs."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe climate crisis requires an array of carbon emission reduction and removal solutions in synergy. DAC is one of the solutions in the portfolio that offers advantages in capturing legacy emissions. The United States has produced the highest proportion of legacy emissions and hence bears the responsibility to set the standard for carbon sequestration (Lebling et al., 2022). Investments by the US in the DAC plants need to be backed by regulatory policies to manage their potentially harmful environmental impacts. The policies need to ensure that the sequestered carbon is not used to further benefit oil and gas drilling. The focus of investments should be first on building renewable energy infrastructure to reduce carbon emissions, and then use the DAC removal strategies to aid the net zero transition. To implement and scale the DAC solutions, strict regulations need to be in place to control leakage accidents. Solid sorbents should be used instead of toxic liquid solvents to avoid water pollution, human health impacts, and ecosystem toxicity. The solid sorbents are also more energy-efficient as they rely on electricity instead of natural gas. In addition to managing environmental impacts and the unintended endorsement of the oil and gas industry, the DAC technology also needs to be developed to have a higher amount of carbon capture per dollar of investment and emit much less carbon than it captures to become a viable solution.\nCitations:\n\nAndreason, J.
