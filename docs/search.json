    "text": "Biogeochemical Cycle Disruption\nLithium extraction and mining have skyrocketed as the world looks for solutions to the climate crisis. This element usually cycles at around 100 million g/year but is now being mobilized at &gt;1,000 million g/year. This is a nearly 500% increase in recent years and we can only expect this number to increase with increasing battery demands. A major cause of human emissions of Li to the atmosphere is through coal combustion."

    "text": "Ecological Disruption\nLithium is available primarily in the brines or related evaporites (66%), in pegmatites (26%) and sedimentary rocks (8%). (Gruber et al., 2011). The conventional methods for lithium mining are through brine evaporation and extraction in open pits from hard rock or clay deposits. The brine deposits are found in the ‘Lithium Triangle’ of Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia. Brine evaporation requires a large amount of water. It has been estimated that 1 ton of Li strip-mined in Chile was estimated to consume 540 tonnes of water and release 5 tonnes of CO2. Evaporation ponds from salt flats, known as salares, deplete water from aquifers in already arid environments. Large hard rock mines are found in Australia. The hard rock mines leak chemicals into water systems causing harm to local ecosystems and indigenous communities in these areas. New proposed lithium mines in Nevada, by a company called Ioneer, are displacing the native endangered buckwheat species."

    "text": "New Extraction Technologies\nA new technology of Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) is being developed to tackle the environmental impacts of conventional methods. It involves adsorption and ion exchange, that use chemical and physical processes to directly remove lithium from brine. An example is in the Imperial Valley in southern California, where large lithium deposits dissolved in brine deep below ground on the southern shore of the Salton Sea. This hot brine is extracted through geothermal wells to generate electricity at 11 power plants and then re-injected back underground. This requires lesser land area for evaporation, lesser water displacement, net energy usage (MIT, 2024), and nearly double the lithium production than current practices (Nicolaci et al., 2023)."

    "section": "Recycling and Alternate Solutions",
    "text": "Recycling and Alternate Solutions\nAnother solution to move away from the impacts of lithium extraction is to increase recycling. It has been proven that creating lithium-ion batteries from recycled battery materials can be up to 48% less in cost and create 54% less environmental impact (Gonzales-Calienes, 2023). Companies such as Redwood Materials in Nevada and Li-Cycle in Toronto are developing hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical technologies to recover minerals from Lithium-ion batteries while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions and other impacts.\nSecondary solutions to reduce overall dependence on lithium include the use of alternate batteries such as sodium-ion for stationary storage. Although sodium-ion batteries are less efficient than lithium and much heavier, their raw material sodium is present abundantly with fewer biogeochemical implications (Gagnon, 2024). Another emerging technology is the iron-air battery which uses a water-based electrolyte and stores energy using reversible rusting. (Asmare et al, 2024)"

By building a more robust public transportation system and encouraging individuals to bike and walk, we can reduce lithium demand by 18-92% (Riofrancos et al., 2023). Such behavior changes in developed countries can reduce lithium dependency substantially."

    "section": "Barriers",
    "text": "Barriers\nThere are several social and economic barriers associated with each of these solutions. The largest barrier to the new DLE technology is the cost. Capital costs for DLE can be double the amount of the traditional lithium extraction methods, although it has a higher recovery rate of 70-90% compared to 30-40% for ponds (Nicolaci et al., 2023). While foreign companies own the machinery and equipment and may not want to invest in more expensive technologies, reducing the land area impact would give lands back, which have cultural and other economic benefits for the locals (MIT, 2024).\nLithium recycling also poses several barriers economically and environmentally. Current lithium recycling processes are extremely limited because of retrieval efficiency. In the European Union in 2012, less than 1% of lithium was recycled (UNEP data). A mass balance analysis reveals that pyrometallurgical lithium recycling has impacts in air pollution, hydrogen fluoride emissions (Fu et al., 2018), wastewater, and solid waste, while the hydrometallurgical route generates high volumes of wastewater (Swain, 2017). In addition, the health risks and effects of long-term high exposure are unknown (Nicolaci et al., 2023). Recycling solutions can only be effective if these impacts are managed. The barrier with alternate batteries is their scalability and energy density as compared to LIB. Reducing overall energy usage seems a straightforward pathway, but behavior change is arguably the most difficult change to make."

This could cover the entire city of Washington, D.C., if spread across a height of 1m. Only 17.4% of this waste was collected and recycled. The rest either ended up in landfills or was traded and informally recycled in developing countries, exposing workers to hazardous and carcinogenic substances such as mercury, lead, and cadmium. E-waste in landfills contaminates soil and groundwater, putting food supply systems and water sources at risk. In addition to the glaring environmental risks, e-waste needs to be recycled to extract the precious metals that would otherwise need to be mined at a higher cost from a depleting non-renewable supply."

In Nigeria, the law prohibits methods like burning plastic cables and acid leaching. However, due to minimal enforcement and low awareness of the health risks, the pickers continue to expose themselves to toxins that cause respiratory and dermatological problems, eye infections, and neurodevelopmental issues.5 The impacts of global e-waste are thus faced disproportionately by countries. The Americas and Europe account for 13.3 and 16.2 kg of e-waste per capita, more than double the generation of Asia and Africa.2 It is inequitable that the rich consume more luxurious electronic products and leave the waste to their poorer neighbors. The affected communities bear the environmental and health risks; and consequences of a problem they did not cause."

Policies must look at e-waste management as an opportunity to not just solve the raw-material scarcity crisis and prevent the detrimental health impacts but also to provide equal technology access to all. If the products are designed to be repairable, an outdated product for one could prove to be useful to another. The life span of each product is thus increased and the amount of e-waste goes down. In 2020, the EU voted for “right to repair” rules for consumer electric goods requiring all new products sold to be repairable for up to 10 years.6 In this way, governments can shape industry strategies."

The environmental impacts of energy production and use of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas) are much higher than the renewables in GHG emissions, pollution, and land-use changes. We need to increase the share of renewable sources (solar and wind) for a clean energy transition because of their lower environmental impacts. The figure below compares energy demands and all renewable energy supplies per day per person in Britain. Assuming a similar trend to be followed in the US, it is possible to rely on renewable energy sources for around 90% of our energy demands. For the remaining 10%, we should rely on nuclear and hydroenergy because of their lower environmental impacts than fossil fuels. The figure counts offshore wind energy in Britain, which could be substituted to some extent with more solar PV energy in the US. The use of biomass should also be lower than what is shown in the figure because of its impacts on land-use changes."

Current mitigation efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are important, but experts agree that carbon dioxide removal is required to keep global temperatures below the critical 1.5°C warming (Lebling et al., 2022).\nDirect air capture (DAC) is a new technology that uses chemical reactions to attract and trap CO2 out of ambient air. The process includes large fans that draw air across either liquid solvents or solid sorbents, which selectively react with carbon dioxide and remove it with 75% efficiency while letting other chemicals pass through (Lebling et al., 2022; Valentine and Zoelle, 2024). Once trapped, the CO2 is released from the solvents and sorbents through a heating process. There are several fates for the captured carbon dioxide. For long-term sequestration, it is injected deep underground, where it will remain for thousands of years. Carbon dioxide can also be sold for use in concrete or plastic, which has a shorter cycle. A third and poorer option is to convert it back into fossil fuels or carbon dioxide for beverages, which releases the carbon immediately back into the air. Capture carbon can also be used in synthetic jet fuel. While this is less emission-intensive than fossil fuels, it promotes the continued use of fossil fuels (Lebling et al., 2022). There are three major companies in direct air capture: Climeworks, Carbon Engineering, and Global Thermostat.

    "text": "Cost and Feasibility\nA case study done in 2024 by the Department of Energy and the National Energy Technology Laboratory explores liquid solvent-based carbon capture to compare the cost and performance estimates of two models with different carbon sequestration capacities. Case 1 had a net carbon removal of 903,970 tons of CO2/year and cost $293/ton. The second case removed 100,000 tons of CO2/year and cost $486/ton. This analysis does not include capital costs of infrastructure and instead assumes mature technology and thus immediate costs may be significantly higher. At this point, the cost of direct air capture is higher than point source CO2 capture and significantly higher than reforestation, which costs $50/ton of CO2 removed (Lebling et al., 2022; Valentine and Zoelle, 2024). The study concluded that direct air capture is still in its large-scale prototype phase and much more research and development needs to be done to drop the costs (Valentine and Zoelle, 2024). While projected costs are high, Climeworks estimates costs to drop to $200/tonne in the next three to four years, with a long-term goal of under $100/tonne by 2030 (ClimeWorks, 2019). This is still double the cost of reforestation."

    "section": "Policies and Regulations",
    "text": "Policies and Regulations\nThere is significant government support through policies and subsidies for the implementation of direct air capture, which will aid in decreasing costs. The Department of Energy has allotted 129 million dollars and has Direct Air Capture Hub awards to help scale the technology (Andreason, 2023). In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act enacted the 45Q Tax Credit that provides $35-50/ton CO2 removal through direct air capture or point source capture. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has set aside several billion dollars for DAC hubs and fund infrastructure like CO2 pipelines and geologic sequestration (Lebling et al., 2022; Valentine and Zoelle, 2024). Current US policies support DAC, but none put limitations on the sale and use of captured carbon, which may limit the positive impacts of DAC."

    "section": "Advantages",
    "text": "Advantages\nDirect air capture promises advantages as being a permanent carbon dioxide storage solution. Unlike many natural solutions, the direct air capture methods are measurable, verifiable, and reportable. It can capture legacy emissions already present in the atmosphere as opposed to carbon capture at its emission point source. A major benefit of direct air capture is its flexibility in land use. It does not require arable land, which minimizes the impact on food production and other land use changes. Also, it requires a smaller amount of land per tonne of CO2 removed than traditional carbon removal techniques like reforestation. (Lebling, 2022). DAC promises the potential of creating well-paying jobs for people with skills in construction, plumbing, electrical works, operations, and manufacturing. While phasing out fossil fuels will lead to high unemployment, skills from the fossil fuel industry are transferable to the DAC industry. (Andreason, J., 2023)."

    "section": "Tradeoffs",
    "text": "Tradeoffs\nThe tradeoffs associated with direct air capture must be weighed while considering its contribution to the carbon removal portfolio. DAC plants require high investments and high energy requirements. The carbon captured in these plants should be considerably higher than the carbon emitted in construction and energy use to pay off the investments. The technology is not yet advanced enough to capture emissions at a large scale. There are issues with leakage during the injection of carbon into the storage wells. The injection could cause fractures in the protective layers of the well. (S. Holloway, 2008). Studies show that fluid injection induces seismicity that poses a further risk of leakage at carbon storage sites. (A. Nicol, 2011). As carbon is often stored around oil and gas wells, the original bores can also create pathways for leaks."

    "text": "Health Risks\nThe leakage of carbon dioxide from pipelines and storage causes severe immediate breathing issues for the local communities. Increased dose of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is deadly and toxic as experienced during the Denbury carbon pipe leaks in Mississippi. (Zegart, 2021) In addition to the carbon pollution in the air and the risk of earthquakes, there are public health and safety issues associated with DAC for vulnerable communities. DAC technology relies on two toxic solvents that have no sustainable disposal solutions yet. (Qiu, 2022) Aqueous hydroxide solutions release deadly and corrosive chlorine gas. (Zhang, 2014) Amine-modified solutions produce chemical carcinogens at a rate that exceeds toxicity limits for drinking water and aquatic ecosystems. (Karl, 2011). These are all serious health risks that must be addressed if DAC is scaled."

    "section": "Mitigation First",
    "text": "Mitigation First\nAlong with the disadvantages and environmental justice concerns, DAC also has unintended impacts in diminished mitigation efforts. DAC has been used as a tool by oil and gas companies to offset emissions and enhance extraction and recovery. Most of the captured carbon goes into oil wells to flush out the last dregs of oil. This will ultimately lead to more emissions with enhanced fossil fuel burning than what was captured. With subsidies and tax credits offered for the DAC projects, the focus is shifting from reducing the emissions at the source. The overall impacts related to local pollution, public health risks, ecosystem toxicity, and the ultimate use of stored carbon should be accounted for before making huge investments in DAC hubs."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe climate crisis requires an array of carbon emission reduction and removal solutions in synergy. DAC is one of the solutions in the portfolio that offers advantages in capturing legacy emissions. The United States has produced the highest proportion of legacy emissions and hence bears the responsibility to set the standard for carbon sequestration (Lebling et al., 2022). Investments by the US in the DAC plants need to be backed by regulatory policies to manage their potentially harmful environmental impacts. The policies need to ensure that the sequestered carbon is not used to further benefit oil and gas drilling. The focus of investments should be first on building renewable energy infrastructure to reduce carbon emissions, and then use the DAC removal strategies to aid the net zero transition. To implement and scale the DAC solutions, strict regulations need to be in place to control leakage accidents. Solid sorbents should be used instead of toxic liquid solvents to avoid water pollution, human health impacts, and ecosystem toxicity. The solid sorbents are also more energy-efficient as they rely on electricity instead of natural gas. In addition to managing environmental impacts and the unintended endorsement of the oil and gas industry, the DAC technology also needs to be developed to have a higher amount of carbon capture per dollar of investment and emit much less carbon than it captures to become a viable solution.\nCitations:\n\nAndreason, J.
