I am a sustainability professional, passionate about solving climate challenges, particularly driving the clean energy transition, decarbonization, and circularity in semiconductor tech and EV battery industries. Starting my career with a background in chemistry and electrical and electronics engineering from BITS-Pilani, I navigated to environmental sustainability with a Master's in Environmental Science and Management at the Bren School of Environment, UC Santa Barbara. 

I learn about new climate solutions and career skills everyday at the Bren community and the larger sustainability network. Join me in my journey as I share my learning outcomes in this space!
