title: "About"

I graduated from BITS-Pilani, India, in 2019 with a dual degree in Chemistry and Electrical Engineering. After graduating, I started as a structural design engineer at Intel, Bangalore, where I worked on optimizing power and frequency in processor design. Here, I also learned about the challenges the semiconductor industry faces in using natural resources for sustainable manufacturing, managing electronic waste, and increasing product energy efficiency.

Inspired to solve natural resources and climate problems I deeply care about, I decided to shift my career and pursue Environmental Science and Management at the Bren School of Environment, UC Santa Barbara. I am specializing in the areas of Business and Sustainability and Energy and Climate. I am particularly interested in circularity, Life Cycle Analysis, renewable energy transition, and emissions management.
